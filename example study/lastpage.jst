    	Thank you for participating in this research study. Your contribution is valuable and will help us better understand 
	how unconscious attitudes may influence diagnostic decision-making, particularly in the context of psychosis diagnoses 
	for Black consumers of mental health care. <br/><br/>

	As part of this study, you completed the Race Implicit Association Test (IAT), which measures automatically activated 
	associations between concepts such as "African Americans" and "European Americans" and evaluative terms like "Good" and 
	"Bad." These automatic associations may differ from your consciously held beliefs. For example, a person might consciously 
	associate African Americans with “Good” but still show an automatic association with “Bad.” These patterns reflect cultural 
	exposure and shared social conditioning, not personal failure or moral flaw.<br/><br/>

	The IAT is not a test of prejudice, racism, or personal values. It is a research tool designed to encourage self-awareness 
	and reflection. Results should be interpreted with care, and no single test should be considered a definitive assessment of 
	a person’s beliefs or biases. The order in which you take the IAT can have a small effect on the results. To reduce this 
	effect, we randomly assign the pairing order and include additional practice rounds before the second task. The order effect 
	is usually minimal, but it is one of several variables that can influence test outcomes.<br/><br/>
 
	Here are your results:

	It is normal to feel discomfort, confusion, or even defensiveness when reviewing IAT results. These reactions are valid and 
	understandable. If you find that the results have triggered emotional discomfort, we encourage you to speak with a trusted 
	colleague, supervisor, or licensed mental health professional. To learn more about the IAT’s purpose, methodology, scoring, 
	and limitations, please visit: https://www.projectimplicit.net/resources/about-the-iat/</p>
